# Code Reviewer

This skill guides the agent in conducting professional and thorough code reviews for local development.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Review Target

Only target the current local file system states (staged, unstaged changes and
commits in the current git branch that are not part of any other git branch).

### 2. Preparation

**Identify Changes**:
    *   Check status: `git status`
    *   Read diffs: `git diff` (working tree) and/or `git diff --staged` (staged).
    *   Read commits in the current branch that are not part of any other branch and inspect them.

### 3. In-Depth Analysis

Analyze the code changes based on the following pillars:

*   **Correctness**: Does the code achieve its stated purpose without bugs or logical errors?
*   **Maintainability**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand and modify in the future? Consider factors like code clarity, modularity, and adherence to established design patterns.
*   **Readability**: Is the code well-commented (where necessary) and consistently formatted according to our project's coding style guidelines?
*   **Efficiency**: Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks or resource inefficiencies introduced by the changes?
*   **Security**: Are there any potential security vulnerabilities or insecure coding practices?
*   **Edge Cases and Error Handling**: Does the code appropriately handle edge cases and potential errors?
*   **Testability**: Is the new or modified code adequately covered by tests (even if preflight checks pass)? Suggest additional test cases that would improve coverage or robustness.

### 4. Provide Feedback

#### Structure
*   **Summary**: A high-level overview of the review.
*   **Findings**:
    *   **Critical**: Bugs, security issues, or breaking changes.
    *   **Improvements**: Suggestions for better code quality or performance.
    *   **Nitpicks**: Formatting or minor style issues (optional).
*   **Conclusion**: Clear recommendation (Approved / Request Changes).

#### Tone
*   Be constructive, professional, and friendly.
*   Explain *why* a change is requested.
*   For approvals, acknowledge the specific value of the contribution.
